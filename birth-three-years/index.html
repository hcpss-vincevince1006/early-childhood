  <h1>Early Childhood Beginnings: Birth to 3 years</h1>
</div>

<div class="lgtb-mg callout-border-prim">

<h2>School Readiness from Birth to 3 years</h2>
<p>Parents are a child’s first and most important teacher. There are many things a parent can do, starting at birth, to help their child. They can support learning during daily activities, such as feeding, bathing, grocery shopping, and playing! Parents can also partner with their child’s teachers, caregivers, pediatrician, and other service providers to help their child be successful.</p>

</div>

<h2>Quick Facts and Figures</h2>

<p>Parents should be aware fo all the different ways they can help their child develop from birth to 3 years. Language interactions and positive experiences are vital for healthy development, but there are many more experiences to focus on as children grow through their early years.</p>

<div class="contents__three-col">
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>During the first three years of life, <strong>the brain grows at an amazing rate (to 80 percent of its adult size)</strong> and forms “connections.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <h3 class="post__paragraph--callout">1,000 trillion connections</h3>
    <p>By the time a child is three, the brain has formed about 1,000 trillion connections, about twice as many as adults have. <strong>These connections are critical</strong> to a child’s healthy growth and development.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>Researchers confirm that <strong>the way parents and caregivers interact</strong> with and provide experiences for young children have a big impact on the child’s emotional development, learning abilities, and ultimately, success in school and later in life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <h3 class="post__paragraph--callout">More than 300 words</h3>
    <p>Researchers found that when mothers <strong>frequently spoke to their infants, their children learned almost 300 more words</strong> by age 2 than did their peers whose mothers rarely spoke with them. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>Studies have suggested that mere exposure to language such as listening to the television or to adults talking amongst themselves provides little benefit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <h3 class="post__paragraph--callout">Focus on the early experiences</h3>
    <p>Research shows that what a child experiences in the first years of life profoundly <strong>influences how his brain will develop</strong> and how he will interact with the world throughout his life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>Parents can foster <strong>healthy cognitive and emotional development</strong> by talking to the children beginning in infancy, reading to them from a very early age, and helping them play simple games.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>Good <strong>nutrition</strong> is one of the best ways we know to aid in healthy brain development.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <h3 class="post__paragraph--callout">Language experience is important</h3>
    <p>It is important to provide a language-rich environment for children. Reading is one way, <strong>but there are many other ways as well</strong>, such as talking, singing, storytelling and listening to music.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <p>For children whose primary language is not English, it is very important for them to <strong>continue learning</strong> in their native language while also being exposed to English.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents__three-col--masonry">
    <h3 class="post__paragraph--callout">Encourage communication</h3>
    <p>When children hear a good deal of “live” language, when they are spoken to often and encouraged to communicate, they are <strong>more proficient with language</strong> than children who have more limited language exposure.</p>

<h2>Birth to 3 Years – Supporting Your Child’s Development</h2>

<div id="list">
  <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Infants (Birth to 1 year)</h3>

  <div class="hide hide--content">
    <section class="contents">
      <div class="col-left">
      <h4>Talk to them</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Respond with words to your infant’s sounds and movements.</li> 
          <li>Repeat her sounds back to her. Talk to her about what you are doing, what she is experiencing, and what is happening around her. ("I’m going to take your diaper off – it may feel cold." "The fan is blowing air on us!")</li>
          <li>Your infant is learning the pattern and rhythm of language.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Sing</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Sing lots of different songs to your infant. Sing lullabies.</li>
          <li>Make up simple songs about your infant or your daily activities.</li> 
          <li>Sing a silly song as you tickle his tummy. Your love and attention helps your infant to focus and listen.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-right">
      <h4>Toys that teach</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide infant toys that squeak, rattle or light up.</li> 
          <li>Simple household containers to put something in and dump it out; containers with lids the infant can take off and try to put back on</li> 
          <li>Safe materials with different textures, like squashy, bumpy, slippery. Your infant is learning about the world around her.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Experience books</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>As soon as your infant can sit by himself, share books with him.</li>
          <li>Choose mostly sturdy books that can be wiped clean, but include some touch and feel books.</li> 
          <li>Point to the pictures with your child. Make animal noises when you share animal books! Your child is learning more language, and learning to love books.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  </div>

  <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Toddlers (1 to 2 years)</h3>

  <div class="hide hide--content">
    <p>Translate your toddler’s gestures into words, and her single words into sentences. (“Would you like more juice in your cup?”) Comment on whatever your child is doing, seeing and feeling. Toddlers are taking in new words all day long</p>

    <p>Dance, jump, clap and tap to the beat of music with your child! Your child is learning to coordinate his movements. He also learns by observing and imitating you.</p>

    <p>Encourage your child to explore toys in different ways – touching, banging, stacking. Play simple turn-taking games, like peek-aboo and hide the teddy bear. Sand and water are fun safe materials for a toddler to explore, especially outdoors where mess doesn’t matter! Your toddler is learning cause and effect — what makes things happen!</p>

    <p>Choose books with big pictures about things that interest your child – bugs, animals, people and machines are a few possibilities. Talk about the pictures. Ask simple questions. (“Where is the caterpillar?”) Your toddler is learning how to hold a book and how to look at it herself.</p>
  </div>

  <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Twos (1 to 2 years)</h3>

  <div class="hide hide--content">
    <p>Ask your child questions that get him thinking. (“What do we need to wipe up this spill?”) Use words that help your child name and understand his feelings. Continue to introduce new vocabulary words. Your two-year-old is learning to use language for many purposes.</p>

    <p>Sing and chant short ABC and number songs. Sing simple rhyming songs. Sing songs about moving different body parts. (“Put your arms up in the air, in the air!”) Two-year-olds love to learn through music.</p>

    <p>Play simple pretend games with your two-year old, like baby dolls, tea party or stuffed animals. Help your child build a road with blocks or do a puzzle. Provide materials that your child can use to create or explore, like crayons, play dough or finger paint. Allow your twoyear- old to help you with simple household tasks. They love to try to sweep, rake or wash things. Your child’s imagination and self-help skills are growing.</p>

    <p>Your two-year-old is ready for story books with simple plots. She will enjoy stories with repeated words or phrases that she can say as you point to the words. Ask her about what happened in the story. (“What did the doggie do then? Where did he hide?”) Encourage your child to choose the book for bedtime, or to “read” the story to you. Be prepared to read her favorite book many times! Your child is learning how books and print work.</p>
